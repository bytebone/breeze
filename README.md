# breeze

A minimalistic windows shell.


### Configuration

Configuration can be done by creating a `breeze.conf` file alongside the binary.
The configuration is pretty simple. An example one can be seen [here](breeze.conf).


### Default Keybinds

- `win + e` - Opens explorer's file explorer.
- `win + r` - Reloads user's configuration.
- `ctrl + alt + shift + q` - Stops breeze and restarts explorer. 


### Roadmap
- [ ] Virtual Destkops
- [ ] Application Launcher (separate tool)
